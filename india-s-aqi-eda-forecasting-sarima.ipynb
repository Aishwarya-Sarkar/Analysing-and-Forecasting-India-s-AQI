A low AQI indicates good air quality and low levels of pollution while a higher AQI suggests increased concentrations of pollutants in the air which is extremely detrimental to human health.\n\nThe air quality index is composed of 8 pollutants ((PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb)\n\nAQI scores and categories:\nGood (0–50)\nSatisfactory (51–100)\nModerately polluted (101–200)\nPoor (201–300)\nVery poor (301–400)\nSevere (401–500)\n\nIn this notebook, we will be using the day-wise AQI dataset which contains information regarding the daily level of pollutants and AQI in around 26 Indian cities from 2015-2020.\n\nOur notebook has two major parts:\n1. Finding the most polluted cities in recent years and analysing the levels of pollutants here. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 induced lockdowns on Air Quality in some of the major cities : analysing which cities underwent the most drastic improvement in Air Quality and which cities showed a spike in AQI levels inspite of a stringent lockdown\n\n2.
